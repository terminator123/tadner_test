## Overview

![Framework of TadNER](framework.jpg)


## 1 Quick Start
Here we give an easy example for training and test on Domain-Transfer / FEW-NERD intra settings.
### 1.1 Environment

Python=3.8

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1.2 train and test Domain Transfer CoNLL2003



```bash
bash run.sh
```

OR

```bash
bash run_fewnerd.sh
```
